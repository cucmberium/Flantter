                2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                   as of the date such litigation is filed.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

                   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                   meet the following conditions:<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                       stating that You changed the files; and<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                       the Derivative Works; and<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                       as modifying the License.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                   the conditions stated in this License.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

                   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

                   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                
                9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

                   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>

                   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                   replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                   the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                   comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                   file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                   same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                   identification within third-party archives.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
